# Let's make the bot smarter together

- The bot only knows how to do the things we tell it to do.
- If we want it to do something new we will need to show it how to do it.

1. Start with a freshly reset bot
   ![Open Browser](EB01.png)
1. Type in "who are you"
    ![Open Browser](EB01.png)
1. Hit Enter or click Send

2. The bot responds but that did not tell us the name of the bot! It looks like it is asking us to give it more information.

1. Click New Topic to begin creating a new topic for the bot.

1. Every topic needs a name so let's use WhoAmI.

1. Since we want the bot to tell us its name let's put that into the Description box.

1. What shoud we use as a trigger phrase to get the bot to start telling us its name?  I'll use "who are you"
    ![Open Browser](EB09.png)
1. Click Add to add it to the list of trigger phrases. 
    ![Open Browser](EB10.png)
1.  Now that we have a way to start the topic, click the Edit button under the conversation.
    ![Open Browser](EB11.png)
1. The bot shows us our trigger phrase and then already loaded a conversation step to say something to the user.  Type in "My name is TestBot"
    ![Open Browser](EB12.png)
1. All we wanted the bot to do was to tell us its name so let's click Save.
    ![Open Browser](EB13.png)
1. OK. Time to test!  Click "Test your bot" in the bottom left corner
    ![Open Browser](EB14.png)
1. Type in "who are you"
    ![Open Browser](EB15.png)
1. Hit enter or click Send
    ![Open Browser](EB16.png)
1. Looks like the bot still doesn't seem to know what we want to do.  What could the problem be?
  - We never told it that it should use the new information! Click "Start over with latest content"
    ![Open Browser](EB17.png)
1. Type in "who are you"
    ![Open Browser](EB18.png)
1. Hit enter or click Send
