##You help our bot get smarter

Since we know the bot will ONLY do what we have told it to do, it needs more of our help to make it smarter.  

Here are a few things you can try to do to help your bot!
- Change the Greeting topic to tell you today's date and say Hello!
- Add some more ways for the bot to tell you its name
- After telling you its name have the bot "Go to" the Greeting topic.

Once you have tried a few of these we'll talk about how you did!
